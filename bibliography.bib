  abstract = {Multiple applications that execute concurrently on heterogeneous platforms
	compete for CPU and network resources. In this paper, we consider
	the problem of scheduling applications to ensure fair and efficient
	execution on a distributed network of processors. We limit our study
	to the case where communication is restricted to a tree embedded
	in the network, and the applications consist of a large number of
	independent tasks that originate at the tree's root. The tasks of
	a given application all have the same computation and communication
	requirements, but these requirements can vary for different applications.
	Each application is given a weight that quantifies its relative value.
	The goal of scheduling is to maximize throughput while executing
	tasks from each application in the same ratio as their weights. We
	can find the optimal asymptotic rates by solving a linear program
	that expresses all necessary problem constraints, and we show how
	to construct a periodic schedule. For single-level trees, the solution
	is characterized by processing tasks with larger communication-to-computation
	ratios at children with larger bandwidths. For multi-level trees,
	this approach requires global knowledge of all application and platform
	parameters. For large-scale platforms, such global coordination by
	a centralized scheduler may be unrealistic. Thus, we also investigate
	decentralized schedulers that use only local information at each
	participating resource. We assess their performance via simulation,
	and compare to a centralized solution obtained via linear programming.
	The best of our decentralized heuristics achieves the same performance
	on about two-thirds of our test cases, but is far worse in a few
	cases. While our results are based on simplistic assumptions and
	do not explore all parameters (such as buffer size), they provide
	insight into the important question of fairly and optimally co-scheduling
	heterogeneous applications on heterogeneous grids.},

  abstract = {Emerging high-performance applications require the ability to exploit
	diverse, geographically distributed resources. These applications
	use high-speed networks to integrate supercomputers, large databases,

	metacomputers. While the physical infrastructure to build such systems
	is becoming widespread, the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the
	metacomputing environment poses new challenges for developers of
	system software, parallel tools, and applications. In this article,
	we introduce Globus, a system that we are developing to address these
	challenges. The Globus system is intended to achieve a vertically
	integrated treatment of application, middleware, and network. A low-level
	toolkit provides basic mechanisms such as communication, authentication,
	network information, and data access. These mechanisms are used to
	construct various higher-level metacomputing services, such as parallel
	programming tools and schedulers. Our long-term goal is to build
	an Adaptive Wide Area Resource Environment (AWARE), an integrated
	set of higher-level services that enable applications to adapt to
	heterogeneous and dynamically changing metacomputing environments.
	Preliminary versions of Globus components were deployed successfully

  abstract = {Many people think of SOA as synchronous RPC (mostly over Web services).
	Others say EDA is SOA. And there are people
	
	who say that the best of EDA and SOA is combined in SOA 2.0. But an
	architectural distinction can be made between a request-
	
	and-reply pattern and a publish-and-subscribe pattern. Both patterns
	are an inverse of each other. Because of the completely
	
	different nature and use of the two patterns, it is necessary to be
	able to distinguish between the both and to name
	
	them. You might say making such a distinction is a universal architectural
	principle. Combining both of the patterns into an
	
	increment of the version number of one of them is not a very clever
	act. It is appropriate and desirable to use the acronyms
	
	SOA and EDA to make this distinction, because SOA and EDA are both
	positioned in the same architectural domain; SOA
	
	focusing on (the decomposition of) business functions and EDA focusing
	on business events. This article explains the differences
	
	between the two patterns, when to use the one or the other and how

  abstract = {Sharing traditional clusters based on multiprogramming systems among
	different Virtual Organizations (VOs) can lead to complex situations
	resulting from the differing software requirements of each VO. This
	complexity could be eliminated if each cluster computing system supported
	only a single VO, thereby permitting the VO to customize the operating
	system and software selection available on its private cluster. While
	dedicating entire physical clusters on the Grid to single VOs is
	not practical in terms of cost and scale, an equivalent separation
	of VOs may be accomplished by deploying clusters of Virtual Machines
	(VMs) in a manner that gives each VO its own virtual cluster. Such
	Virtual Organization Clusters (VOCs) can have numerous benefits,
	including isolation of VOs from one another, independence of each
	VOC from the underlying hardware, allocation of physical resources
	on a per-VO basis, and clear separation of administrative responsibilities
	between the physical fabric provider and the VO itself.
	
	
	Initial results of implementing a complete system utilizing the proposed
	Virtual Organization Cluster Model confirm the administrative simplicity
	of isolating VO software from the physical system. End-user computational
	jobs submitted through the Grid are executed only on the virtual
	cluster supporting the respective VO, and each VO has substantial
	administrative flexibility in terms of software choice and system
	configuration. Performance tests using the Kernel-based Virtual Machine
	(KVM) hypervisor indicated a virtualization overhead of under 10%
	for latency-tolerant scientific applications, such as those that
	would be submitted to a standard or vanilla Condor universe. Latency-sensitive
	applications, such as MPI, experience substantial performance degradation
	with virtualization overheads on the order of 60%. These results
	suggest that VOCs are suitable for High-Throughput Computing (HTC)
	applications, where real-time network performance is not critical.
	VOCs might also be useful for High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications
	if virtual network performance can be sufficiently improved.},

	This paper describes a virtual cluster scheduler implementation based

	belonging to each Virtual Organization are then run on the organization-specific

	are terminated, thereby allowing the physical resources to be re-claimed.
	Tests of this system were conducted using synthetic workloads, demonstrating

  abstract = {This paper describes a virtual networking approach for grids called
	ViNe. It enables symmetric connectivity among grid resources and
	allows existing applications to run unmodified. Novel features of
	the ViNe architecture include: easy virtual networking administration;
	support for physical private networks and support for multiple independent
	virtual networks in the same infrastructure. The requirements of
	an application-friendly virtual network environment are presented
	and it is shown how the proposed solution meets them. Qualitative
	arguments are provided to justify all design decisions. Also presented
	is an experimental evaluation of the round-trip latencies and bandwidths
	achieved by a reference implementation. Measurements are reported
	for WAN-scenarios involving three different institutions. Under favorable
	conditions, ViNe bandwidths are within 90 to 100% of the available
	physical network bandwidth},
